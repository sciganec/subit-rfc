### *SUBIT‑RFC Extension: Economic Coordination Layer and System Models*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

SUBIT‑Economic defines the economic coordination layer of the SUBIT protocol. It extends SUBIT‑RFC by specifying:

- the economic meaning of agent states,  
- the logic of resource allocation through coherence,  
- the operational role of MATCH‑ENGINE in economic flows,  
- the behavior of agents, communities, cities, and states under SUBIT,  
- the transition pathways from legacy economic systems,  
- simulation models for testing and deployment.

SUBIT‑Economic is not a market, not a planned economy, and not a hybrid.  
It is a **coherence‑driven economic architecture**, where:

- **NEED** and **CAP** define structure,  
- **CONTR** and **TRUST** define access,  
- **FIT** defines priority,  
- **MATCH‑ENGINE** defines coordination,  
- **SUBIT‑64** defines ontology.

This document is designed to be integrated directly into SUBIT‑RFC as the economic layer.

---

## **2. Conceptual Foundations**

### **2.1. Economics as a Coordination Problem**
Traditional economics solves coordination through:

- **price** (market),  
- **directive** (plan).

Both compress information into a single scalar.  
SUBIT preserves full multidimensionality through **agent state vectors**.

### **2.2. Information Architecture**
SUBIT treats the economy as a distributed information system:

- agents publish states,  
- the field aggregates them,  
- MATCH‑ENGINE computes coherence‑maximizing configurations.

### **2.3. Field Coherence**
Coherence is the central economic metric.  
Economic efficiency = **maximizing global FIT**.

Coherence replaces:

- profit maximization,  
- bureaucratic compliance,  
- political negotiation.

---

## **3. Agent State Model (Economic Layer)**

SUBIT‑RFC defines *Agent State* abstractly.  
SUBIT‑Economic formalizes it through five canonical vectors.

### **3.1. NEED (Demand Vector)**
Structural deficits preventing optimal functioning.

Categories include:

- essential (energy, housing, safety),  
- operational (tools, knowledge, access),  
- social (support, coordination),  
- developmental (learning, scaling).

NEED is not desire; it is **structural necessity**.

### **3.2. CAP (Capability Vector)**
Potential contributions:

- skills,  
- resources,  
- time,  
- cognitive capacity,  
- infrastructure access.

CAP is not a promise; it is **latent potential**.

### **3.3. CONTR (Contribution Ledger)**
Historical record of actions that increased field coherence.

CONTR is:

- cumulative,  
- domain‑specific,  
- non‑monetary,  
- non‑transferable.

### **3.4. TRUST (Reliability Metric)**
Predictability and consistency of agent behavior.

Derived from:

- MATCH completion,  
- CAP accuracy,  
- temporal stability,  
- absence of parasitic behavior.

### **3.5. FIT (Coherence Contribution Metric)**
Primary economic signal.

FIT measures:

- how much an agent increases coherence,  
- how well the agent integrates into the field,  
- how structurally aligned the agent is with SUBIT‑64 domains.

FIT determines priority in resource allocation.

---

## **4. Resource Allocation Logic**

### **4.1. Allocation Principle**
Resources flow to configurations that maximize:

- NEED satisfaction,  
- CAP activation,  
- CONTR reinforcement,  
- TRUST stability,  
- FIT growth.

### **4.2. Priority Determination**
Priority is determined by:

- CONTR (past contribution),  
- TRUST (reliability),  
- FIT (coherence impact).

### **4.3. Scarcity Handling**
In scarcity, MATCH‑ENGINE increases the weight of FIT.  
This ensures:

- minimal disruption,  
- maximal structural benefit,  
- resilience under stress.

---

## **5. Match Engine (Economic Mode)**

### **5.1. Inputs**
MATCH‑ENGINE receives:

- NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT vectors,  
- SUBIT‑64 domain ontology,  
- local and global field parameters.

### **5.2. Outputs**
MATCH‑ENGINE produces:

- optimal matches,  
- resource routes,  
- priority queues,  
- coherence‑maximizing configurations.

### **5.3. Coherence Function**
Global coherence function:

\[
U = f( S_{NEED}, S_{CAP}, S_{CONTR}, S_{TRUST}, S_{FIT} )
\]

MATCH‑ENGINE maximizes \(U\) subject to constraints.

## **6. Economic Processes in SUBIT**

### **6.1. Production**
Production emerges where:

- CAP is high,  
- NEED is stable,  
- FIT is maximized.

### **6.2. Exchange**
Exchange = MATCH between CAP and NEED.

No money is required inside a SUBIT field.

### **6.3. Investment**
Investment flows to domains with the highest FIT growth rate.

### **6.4. Innovation**
Innovation emerges where:

- NEED is unmet,  
- CAP is strong,  
- CONTR is stable.

---

## **7. Anti‑Parasitic Dynamics**

SUBIT‑Economic prevents parasitism structurally:

- low CONTR → low priority,  
- low TRUST → reduced access,  
- low FIT → isolation from critical flows.

No policing is required.  
The field self‑stabilizes.

---

## **8. Social Systems in SUBIT‑Economic**

### **8.1. Social Support**
Support flows to agents with:

- high NEED,  
- low CAP,  
- high TRUST.

### **8.2. Education**
Education is a MATCH between learning NEED and teaching CAP.

### **8.3. Healthcare**
Healthcare allocation is FIT‑driven:

- critical NEED,  
- high TRUST,  
- high coherence impact.

---

## **9. Urban‑Scale SUBIT‑Economic**

### **9.1. Transport**
Routes adapt dynamically to NEED patterns.

### **9.2. Energy**
Energy flows to maximize FIT.

### **9.3. Space**
Urban space is allocated by structural coherence, not price.

---

## **10. National‑Scale SUBIT‑Economic**

### **10.1. Budget Formation**
Budget emerges from aggregated NEED/CONTR/TRUST.

### **10.2. Strategy**
Strategy = maximizing national FIT.

### **10.3. Taxation Replacement**
Taxation is replaced by CONTR‑based contribution logic.

---

## **11. Global‑Scale SUBIT‑Economic**

### **11.1. Cross‑Field Flows**
MATCH‑ENGINE optimizes cross‑border flows.

### **11.2. Ecology Integration**
Environmental parameters are integrated into FIT.

### **11.3. Global Stability**
Coherence reduces geopolitical conflict structurally.

---

## **12. Transition Pathways to SUBIT‑Economic**

### **12.1. Local Fields**
Initial deployments:

- cooperatives,  
- campuses,  
- districts.

### **12.2. Inter‑Field Networks**
Standardized states → inter‑field MATCH.

### **12.3. Urban Integration**
City‑scale MATCH‑ENGINE → economy of flows.

### **12.4. National Integration**
SUBIT becomes macro‑coordination layer.

### **12.5. Global Coherence**
Integration of ecological and economic flows globally.

---

## **13. Simulation Models**

### **13.1. Agent‑Based Simulation**
Agents modeled with:

- NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT vectors,  
- domain‑specific behaviors,  
- dynamic MATCH interactions.

### **13.2. Field Simulation**
Field modeled as:

- coherence surface,  
- resource flow network,  
- dynamic equilibrium system.

### **13.3. Shock Scenarios**
Simulate:

- scarcity,  
- migration,  
- ecological collapse,  
- innovation waves.

### **13.4. Metrics**
Key metrics:

- global FIT,  
- local deficits,  
- CONTR accumulation,  
- TRUST stability.

## **14. Invariants (Economic Layer)**

1. **State Transparency** — economic decisions require open NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT.  
2. **No Concentration of Power** — FIT cannot be monopolized.  
3. **FIT Non‑Degradation** — decisions that reduce coherence are invalid.  
4. **Protocol Evolution** — rules adapt through simulation layers.  
5. **No Coercion** — MATCH‑ENGINE proposes, never forces.

---

## **15. Summary**

SUBIT‑Economic is a coherence‑driven economic architecture where:

- NEED and CAP define structure,  
- CONTR and TRUST define access,  
- FIT defines priority,  
- MATCH‑ENGINE defines coordination,
