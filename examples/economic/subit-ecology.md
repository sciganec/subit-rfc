### *SUBIT‑RFC Extension: Ecological Coordination Layer (SUBIT‑Ecology)*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

SUBIT‑Ecology defines the **ecological coordination layer** of the SUBIT protocol. It specifies:

- how ecological states integrate into NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT,  
- how MATCH‑ENGINE optimizes ecological flows,  
- how ecological coherence becomes a structural property of the field,  
- how ecological regeneration emerges from distributed coordination,  
- how ecological constraints shape economic and governance decisions,  
- how SUBIT transitions systems from extractive to regenerative dynamics.

SUBIT‑Ecology is not environmental policy, not carbon accounting, and not a regulatory framework.  
It is a **structural ecological protocol**, where ecological stability emerges from coherence, not enforcement.

---

## **2. Ecological Principles**

### **2.1. Ecology as a structural layer**
Ecology is not an external constraint.  
It is a **core dimension of FIT**.

### **2.2. Regeneration over mitigation**
SUBIT prioritizes actions that increase ecological coherence, not merely reduce harm.

### **2.3. Distributed ecological intelligence**
Ecological decisions emerge from:

- local sensors,  
- agent states,  
- MATCH‑ENGINE optimization,  
- domain topology.

### **2.4. No ecological externalities**
Ecological impacts are internal to FIT.  
Nothing can be “externalized”.

### **2.5. Ecological invariants**
No decision is valid if it reduces ecological FIT.

---

## **3. Ecological State Model**

Ecological parameters integrate directly into the five SUBIT vectors.

### **3.1. Ecological NEED**
Represents ecological deficits:

- clean air,  
- clean water,  
- soil health,  
- biodiversity,  
- green space,  
- noise reduction,  
- climate stability.

Ecological NEED is measured as:

```
NEED_ecology = { air, water, soil, biodiversity, noise, climate }
```

### **3.2. Ecological CAP**
Represents ecological capabilities:

- renewable energy,  
- waste processing,  
- water purification,  
- soil regeneration,  
- ecological monitoring,  
- green infrastructure.

```
CAP_ecology = { energy_renewable, recycling, water_cleaning, soil_regen, sensors }
```

### **3.3. Ecological CONTR**
Represents contributions to ecological stability:

- emissions reduction,  
- waste reduction,  
- habitat restoration,  
- resource efficiency,  
- regenerative practices.

```
CONTR_ecology(t+1) = CONTR_ecology(t) + ContributionValue
```

### **3.4. Ecological TRUST**
Represents reliability of ecological behavior:

- consistent low emissions,  
- stable resource use,  
- predictable ecological impact.

```
TRUST_ecology(t+1) = TRUST_ecology(t) + α*Success − β*Failure
```

### **3.5. Ecological FIT**
Represents ecological coherence contribution:

- positive ecological impact,  
- alignment with ecological domains,  
- reduction of ecological stress.

```
FIT_ecology = f( NEED_ecology, CAP_ecology, CONTR_ecology, TRUST_ecology )
```

## **4. Ecological MATCH‑ENGINE**

### **4.1. Inputs**
MATCH‑ENGINE receives:

- ecological NEED vectors,  
- ecological CAP vectors,  
- ecological CONTR histories,  
- ecological TRUST metrics,  
- ecological FIT scores,  
- SUBIT‑64 ecological domains.

### **4.2. Objective**
MATCH‑ENGINE maximizes ecological coherence:

```
U_ecology = f( NEED_ecology, CAP_ecology, CONTR_ecology, TRUST_ecology, FIT_ecology )
```

### **4.3. Outputs**
- ecological resource routes,  
- ecological restoration priorities,  
- ecological risk mitigation pathways,  
- ecological MATCH configurations.

### **4.4. Invariant**
No ecological decision is valid if:

```
FIT_ecology(t+1) < FIT_ecology(t)
```

## **5. Ecological Processes**

### **5.1. Ecological Resource Allocation**
Resources flow to:

- areas with high ecological NEED,  
- agents with strong ecological CAP,  
- actions with high ecological FIT.

### **5.2. Ecological Restoration**
MATCH‑ENGINE identifies:

- degraded zones,  
- ecological bottlenecks,  
- regeneration opportunities.

### **5.3. Ecological Monitoring**
Sensors and agents publish ecological states:

- air quality,  
- water quality,  
- soil metrics,  
- biodiversity indices.

### **5.4. Ecological Crisis Response**
During ecological crises:

- NEED spikes,  
- CAP reallocation accelerates,  
- CONTR and TRUST update rapidly,  
- MATCH‑ENGINE prioritizes ecological stabilization.

## **6. Ecological Domains (SUBIT‑64 Integration)**

Ecological domains map into SUBIT‑64:

- energy,  
- water,  
- soil,  
- biodiversity,  
- climate,  
- waste,  
- land use,  
- atmospheric flows.

Each domain has:

- NEED vectors,  
- CAP vectors,  
- CONTR logs,  
- TRUST metrics,  
- FIT contributions.

## **8. Ecological Governance**

### **8.1. Local Ecological Governance**
Local fields manage:

- waste,  
- water,  
- noise,  
- microclimate.

### **8.2. Urban Ecological Governance**
Cities manage:

- transport emissions,  
- energy flows,

- water cycles,  
- biodiversity corridors.

### **8.3. National Ecological Governance**
Nations manage:

- large‑scale ecosystems,

- forests,  
- climate adaptation.

### **8.4. Global Ecological Governance**
Global MATCH‑ENGINE manages:

- climate flows,  
- ocean health,  
- global biodiversity,  
- cross‑border ecological risks.

## **9. Ecological Transition Pathway**

Transition follows the same phases as SUBIT‑Economic:

```
Local → Inter‑Field → Urban → National → Global
```

### **9.1. Local Ecological Adoption**
- local sensors,  
- local ecological MATCH,  
- local FIT stabilization.

### **9.2. Inter‑Field Ecological Networks**
- shared ecological protocols,  
- ecological flow optimization.

### **9.3. Urban Ecological Integration**
- city‑scale ecological MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- integrated ecological flows.

### **9.4. National Ecological Integration**
- national ecological FIT optimization,  
- distributed ecological planning.

### **9.5. Global Ecological Integration**
- global MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- planetary coherence.

## **10. Ecological Invariants**

1. **Ecological transparency** — ecological states must be open.  
2. **No ecological externalities** — all impacts affect FIT.  
3. **FIT non‑degradation** — ecological FIT cannot decrease.  
4. **No coercion** — ecological actions emerge from MATCH, not force.  
5. **Protocol evolution** — ecological rules evolve through simulation.

---

## **11. Final Ecological Condition**

SUBIT‑Ecology is fully deployed when:

- ecological decisions emerge from MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- ecological FIT determines priority,  
- ecological NEED/CAP determine structure,  
- ecological CONTR/TRUST determine access,  
- ecological invariants shape all decisions,  
- ecological regeneration becomes a structural property of the field.

At this stage, ecology becomes a **self‑optimizing, distributed, regenerative system** integrated into all economic and governance flows.
