### *SUBIT‑RFC Extension: Governance Coordination Layer (SUBIT‑Governance)*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

SUBIT‑Governance defines the **coordination and decision‑making layer** of the SUBIT protocol. It specifies:

- how governance emerges from agent states,  
- how decisions are formed through coherence rather than authority,  
- how MATCH‑ENGINE operates in governance mode,  
- how local, urban, national, and global governance layers interoperate,  
- how SUBIT prevents concentration of power,  
- how governance evolves through simulation layers,  
- how FIT becomes the structural foundation of legitimacy.

SUBIT‑Governance is not democracy, not technocracy, not algorithmic rule, and not centralized planning.  
It is a **distributed governance architecture** where decisions emerge from the coherence of NEED, CAP, CONTR, TRUST, and FIT across the field.

---

## **2. Governance Principles**

### **2.1. Coherence over authority**
Governance decisions are valid only if they **increase field coherence**.

### **2.2. No concentration of power**
No agent or institution can accumulate structural dominance.  
Power = FIT, and FIT cannot be monopolized.

### **2.3. Transparency of states**
Governance requires open NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT for all agents affecting the field.

### **2.4. No coercion**
SUBIT proposes; agents choose.  
Governance emerges from alignment, not force.

### **2.5. Evolution through simulation**
Governance rules evolve through simulation layers before deployment.

---

## **3. Governance State Model**

Governance uses the same five vectors as SUBIT‑Economic, but interpreted structurally.

### **3.1. NEED (Governance Demand)**
Represents governance‑relevant deficits:

- infrastructure gaps,  
- social instability,  
- ecological stress,  
- coordination failures.

### **3.2. CAP (Governance Capability)**
Represents governance‑relevant capacities:

- institutional capability,  
- expertise,  
- infrastructure,  
- coordination networks.

### **3.3. CONTR (Governance Contribution)**
Represents historical contributions to:

- stability,  
- coherence,  
- crisis mitigation,  
- public goods.

### **3.4. TRUST (Governance Reliability)**
Represents:

- consistency of actions,  
- alignment with field coherence,  
- absence of parasitic behavior.

### **3.5. FIT (Governance Coherence Contribution)**
Represents:

- how much an agent or institution increases governance coherence,  
- how well it integrates into the governance field,  
- how structurally aligned it is with SUBIT‑64 domains.

FIT is the **legitimacy metric** in SUBIT‑Governance.

---

## **4. Governance MATCH‑ENGINE**

### **4.1. Inputs**
MATCH‑ENGINE receives:

- aggregated NEED vectors,  
- CAP vectors of institutions and agents,  
- CONTR histories,  
- TRUST metrics,  
- FIT scores,  
- SUBIT‑64 domain topology.

### **4.2. Objective**
MATCH‑ENGINE selects governance configurations that maximize:

```
U = f( NEED, CAP, CONTR, TRUST, FIT )
```

### **4.3. Outputs**
- governance recommendations,  
- resource allocation priorities,  
- institutional configurations,  
- coordination pathways,  
- conflict minimization routes.

### **4.4. Invariant**
No governance decision is valid if:

```
FIT_global(t+1) < FIT_global(t)
```

---

## **5. Governance Structures**

SUBIT‑Governance uses **distributed structures**, not hierarchical ones.

### **5.1. Local Governance Fields**
Small‑scale governance:

- neighborhoods,  
- cooperatives,  
- campuses,  
- local clusters.

Local governance emerges from local coherence.

### **5.2. Network Councils**
Councils exist at:

- local,  
- district,  
- city,  
- regional,  
- national levels.

Councils do not vote or command.  
They **interpret states** and **validate coherence**.

### **5.3. Coherence Core**
A meta‑agent responsible for:

- maintaining SUBIT‑64 ontology,  
- validating invariants,  
- running simulation layers,  
- ensuring protocol integrity.

### **5.4. Simulation Layers**
All governance changes must pass through:

- modeling,  
- stress testing,  
- FIT impact analysis,  
- ecological and social coherence checks.

---

## **6. Governance Processes**

### **6.1. Decision Formation**
Governance decisions emerge from:

1. agents publishing NEED/CAP/CONTR/TRUST/FIT  
2. MATCH‑ENGINE generating governance configurations  
3. councils validating coherence  
4. agents adopting or rejecting proposals  
5. FIT updating based on outcomes

### **6.2. Conflict Resolution**
Conflicts are resolved by:

- identifying FIT‑reducing interactions,  
- generating MATCH configurations that minimize tension,  
- reallocating resources or responsibilities.

### **6.3. Crisis Governance**
During crises:

- NEED spikes,  
- CAP reallocation accelerates,  
- CONTR and TRUST update rapidly,  
- MATCH‑ENGINE prioritizes FIT stabilization.

### **6.4. Policy Evolution**
Policies evolve through:

- simulation layers,  
- FIT impact analysis,  
- distributed adoption.

## **7. Governance at Different Scales**

### **7.1. Local Governance**
Focus:

- immediate NEED,  
- local CAP,  
- community coherence.

### **7.2. Urban Governance**
Focus:

- transport,  
- energy,  
- space,  
- social services,  
- ecological flows.

### **7.3. National Governance**
Focus:

- strategic resource allocation,  
- infrastructure,  
- ecological stability,  
- crisis response.

### **7.4. Global Governance**
Focus:

- cross‑border flows,  
- ecological regeneration,  
- conflict minimization,  
- global FIT.

---

## **8. Anti‑Concentration Mechanisms**

SUBIT‑Governance prevents power accumulation structurally.

### **8.1. FIT cannot be monopolized**
FIT decreases if an agent:

- hoards resources,  
- blocks flows,  
- creates dependency,  
- reduces coherence.

### **8.2. CONTR cannot be faked**
CONTR is based on real actions only.

### **8.3. TRUST is behavior‑based**
TRUST updates automatically:

```
TRUST(t+1) = TRUST(t) + α*Success − β*Failure
```

### **8.4. MATCH‑ENGINE distributes responsibility**
No single agent can dominate MATCH cycles.

## **9. Governance Metrics**

### **9.1. Coherence Metrics**
- global FIT  
- local FIT  
- domain FIT  
- FIT volatility  
- FIT growth rate

### **9.2. Governance Metrics**
- decision stability  
- conflict reduction  
- resource flow efficiency  
- institutional reliability

### **9.3. Social Metrics**
- trust distribution  
- contribution distribution  
- NEED satisfaction rate

### **9.4. Ecological Metrics**
- ecological FIT  
- resource regeneration rate  
- ecological stress index

---

## **10. Governance Transition Pathway**

Governance transition follows the same phases as SUBIT‑Economic:

```
Local → Inter‑Field → Urban → National → Global
```

### **10.1. Local Governance Adoption**
- local MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- local councils,  
- local FIT stabilization.

### **10.2. Inter‑Field Governance**
- shared governance protocols,  
- inter‑field coherence.

### **10.3. Urban Governance**
- city‑scale MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- integrated governance flows.

### **10.4. National Governance**
- national FIT optimization,  
- distributed strategic planning.

### **10.5. Global Governance**
- global MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- ecological and economic coherence.

---

## **11. Final Governance Condition**

SUBIT‑Governance is fully deployed when:

- governance decisions emerge from MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- FIT determines legitimacy,  
- NEED/CAP determine structure,  
- CONTR/TRUST determine responsibility,  
- simulation layers validate all changes,  
- no agent or institution can accumulate power.

At this stage, governance becomes a **distributed coherence system**, not a hierarchy.
