### *SUBIT‑RFC Extension: Financial Coordination Layer (SUBIT‑Finance)*

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

SUBIT‑Finance defines the **financial coordination layer** of the SUBIT protocol. It specifies:

- how financial functions are performed without money as a universal medium,  
- how resource allocation replaces monetary exchange,  
- how FIT becomes the structural equivalent of purchasing power,  
- how CONTR and TRUST replace credit and capital,  
- how MATCH‑ENGINE replaces markets and financial institutions,  
- how savings, investment, insurance, and budgeting operate in a coherence‑driven system,  
- how SUBIT integrates with external monetary economies.

SUBIT‑Finance is not a currency system, not a token economy, and not a blockchain.  
It is a **post‑monetary financial architecture**, where coordination emerges from NEED, CAP, CONTR, TRUST, and FIT.

---

## **2. Financial Principles**

### **2.1. Finance as resource coordination**
Finance is redefined as the **movement of resources**, not the movement of money.

### **2.2. FIT as universal equivalence**
FIT replaces price as the primary signal of value and priority.

### **2.3. CONTR as structural capital**
CONTR replaces accumulated wealth with accumulated contribution.

### **2.4. TRUST as creditworthiness**
TRUST replaces credit scores and collateral.

### **2.5. MATCH‑ENGINE as financial infrastructure**
MATCH‑ENGINE replaces:

- markets,  
- banks,  
- exchanges,  
- credit systems.

---

## **3. Financial State Model**

Financial coordination uses the same five vectors as SUBIT‑Economic, interpreted financially.

### **3.1. Financial NEED**
Represents resource deficits requiring allocation:

- tools,  
- energy,  
- space,  
- time,  
- infrastructure,  
- knowledge.

```
NEED_finance = { tools, energy, space, time, knowledge }
```

### **3.2. Financial CAP**
Represents resource‑generating capabilities:

- production capacity,  
- skills,  
- infrastructure,  
- labor,  
- knowledge creation.

```
CAP_finance = { production, skills, infra, labor, knowledge }
```

### **3.3. Financial CONTR**
Represents accumulated contribution to the field:

- completed MATCH cycles,  
- resource provision,  
- problem solving,  
- innovation.

```
CONTR_finance(t+1) = CONTR_finance(t) + ContributionValue
```

### **3.4. Financial TRUST**
Represents reliability in resource use and MATCH completion.

```
TRUST_finance(t+1) = TRUST_finance(t) + α*Success − β*Failure
```

### **3.5. Financial FIT**
Represents the agent’s contribution to financial coherence.

```
FIT_finance = f( NEED_finance, CAP_finance, CONTR_finance, TRUST_finance )
```

FIT determines access to resources.

---

## **4. Financial MATCH‑ENGINE**

### **4.1. Inputs**
MATCH‑ENGINE receives:

- financial NEED vectors,  
- financial CAP vectors,  
- CONTR histories,  
- TRUST metrics,  
- FIT scores,  
- resource availability.

### **4.2. Objective**
MATCH‑ENGINE maximizes financial coherence:

```
U_finance = f( NEED_finance, CAP_finance, CONTR_finance, TRUST_finance, FIT_finance )
```

### **4.3. Outputs**
- resource allocation decisions,  
- investment routes,  
- priority queues,  
- savings and insurance flows,  
- financial stabilization actions.

### **4.4. Invariant**
No financial decision is valid if:

```
FIT_finance(t+1) < FIT_finance(t)
```

---

## **5. Financial Functions in SUBIT**

SUBIT‑Finance replaces traditional financial functions with coherence‑driven equivalents.

### **5.1. Payments**
Payments are replaced by **resource flows** triggered by MATCH‑ENGINE.

### **5.2. Pricing**
Prices are replaced by **FIT‑based prioritization**.

### **5.3. Credit**
Credit is replaced by **TRUST + CAP + CONTR**.

### **5.4. Capital**
Capital is replaced by **CONTR + FIT**.

### **5.5. Investment**
Investment is the allocation of resources to maximize FIT growth.

### **5.6. Savings**
Savings are replaced by:

- stable TRUST,  
- accumulated CONTR,  
- predictable FIT.

### **5.7. Insurance**
Insurance is replaced by:

- MATCH‑ENGINE risk redistribution,  
- TRUST‑weighted support flows.

### **5.8. Budgeting**
Budgets emerge from aggregated NEED and CAP.

---

## **6. Resource Allocation Logic**

### **6.1. Allocation Principle**
Resources flow to configurations that maximize:

- NEED satisfaction,  
- CAP activation,  
- CONTR reinforcement,  
- TRUST stability,  
- FIT growth.

### **6.2. Priority Determination**
Priority is determined by:

- CONTR (past contribution),  
- TRUST (reliability),  
- FIT (coherence impact).

### **6.3. Scarcity Handling**
In scarcity, MATCH‑ENGINE increases the weight of FIT.

---

## **7. Financial Processes**

### **7.1. Internal Resource Exchange**
Agents exchange resources through MATCH cycles:

```
NEED → MATCH → CAP → CONTR → TRUST → FIT
```

### **7.2. Investment Process**
Investment is defined as:

```
Investment = ResourceFlow that maximizes ΔFIT
```

### **7.3. Savings Process**
Savings are defined as:

```
Savings = Stability( TRUST, CONTR, FIT )
```

### **7.4. Insurance Process**
Insurance is defined as:

```
Insurance = MATCH redistribution during negative events
```

### **7.5. Budget Formation**
Budgets emerge from aggregated NEED and CAP:

```
Budget = Aggregate( NEED_finance, CAP_finance )
```

---

## **8. Financial Institutions in SUBIT**

SUBIT‑Finance replaces traditional institutions with distributed structures.

### **8.1. Resource Pools**
Pools of:

- tools,  
- energy,  
- space,  
- knowledge,  
- infrastructure.

### **8.2. Contribution Ledger**
Distributed CONTR logs.

### **8.3. Trust Network**
Distributed TRUST metrics.

### **8.4. Coherence Core**
Ensures:

- FIT integrity,  
- simulation validation,  
- protocol invariants.

### **8.5. MATCH‑ENGINE**
The central financial coordinator.

---

## **9. Integration with External Monetary Economies**

SUBIT can coexist with monetary systems.

### **9.1. External Interface**
Money is used only for:

- external purchases,  
- cross‑system transactions,  
- market interactions.

### **9.2. Internal Logic**
Inside SUBIT:

- no money,  
- no prices,  
- no debt,  
- no interest.

### **9.3. Conversion Layer**
External money → internal resources:

```
Money → Resource → MATCH → FIT
```

---

## **10. Financial Transition Pathway**

Transition follows the same phases as SUBIT‑Economic:

```
Local → Inter‑Field → Urban → National → Global
```

### **10.1. Local Finance**
- local resource pools,  
- local MATCH cycles.

### **10.2. Inter‑Field Finance**
- shared resource flows,  
- distributed CONTR and TRUST.

### **10.3. Urban Finance**
- city‑scale resource allocation,  
- integrated financial flows.

### **10.4. National Finance**
- national FIT optimization,  
- distributed budgeting.

### **10.5. Global Finance**
- global MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- planetary resource coherence.

---

## **11. Final Financial Condition**

SUBIT‑Finance is fully deployed when:

- financial decisions emerge from MATCH‑ENGINE,  
- FIT determines access and priority,  
- NEED/CAP determine structure,  
- CONTR/TRUST determine reliability,  
- resource flows replace monetary flows,  
- ecological and social parameters are integrated into FIT.

At this stage, finance becomes a **distributed, post‑monetary coherence system**.
