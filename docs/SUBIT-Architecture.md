# SUBIT Architecture  
*Structural Model, Isomorphisms, and 64‑Archetype Framework*  
Version 1.0 — February 2026

This document defines the **architectural foundations** of the SUBIT system:  
its axes, bit‑structure, isomorphic layers, and the generative logic behind the 64 archetypes.

SUBIT is a **6‑axis structural operator**:

**Tension → Vector → Interaction → Meaning → Action → Structure**

Each axis is binary (Yin/Yang), producing a 6‑bit state space of 64 archetypes.

---

# 1. Core Model

## 1.1 SUBIT as a 6‑bit Register
A SUBIT state is defined as:

```
SUBIT = {0,1}^6
```

This yields:

```
2^6 = 64 structural archetypes
```

Each bit corresponds to one axis:

| Bit | Axis        | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| b1  | Tension     | unresolved force, uncertainty |
| b2  | Vector      | direction of movement or intention |
| b3  | Interaction | relationship between elements |
| b4  | Meaning     | pattern or interpretation |
| b5  | Action      | transformation or event |
| b6  | Structure   | resulting configuration |

Each bit has two polarities:

- **0 = Yin** (latent, receptive, passive)  
- **1 = Yang** (active, directed, manifest)

# 2. Axis Semantics

## 2.1 Tension (T)
Identifies the core unresolved force, conflict, or ambiguity.

## 2.2 Vector (V)
Specifies the direction of movement, intention, or drive.

## 2.3 Interaction (I)
Describes how elements, agents, or forces relate.

## 2.4 Meaning (M)
Extracts the underlying pattern or interpretation.

## 2.5 Action (A)
Represents the transformation, decision, or event.

## 2.6 Structure (S)
Defines the resulting configuration or stable form.

# 3. Isomorphic Representations

SUBIT is intentionally **multi‑representational**.  
All encodings below are mathematically equivalent.

---

## 3.1 Binary Encoding (canonical)
```
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6
```

Example:
```
010111
```

---

## 3.2 Bigram Encoding (3 × 2‑bit)
```
(00, 01, 10, 11)^3
```

Example:
```
["01", "01", "11"]
```

---

## 3.3 Trigram Encoding (2 × 3‑bit)
Two trigrams from the canonical 8‑trigram set:

```
000 Heaven
001 Lake
010 Fire
011 Thunder
100 Wind
101 Water
110 Mountain
111 Earth
```

Example:
```
["010", "111"] = Fire over Earth
```

---

## 3.4 Color Encoding (2‑color pair)
The canonical 8‑color palette:

```
Blue, Green, Lime, Yellow, Orange, Red, Burgundy, Purple
```

Example:
```
["Lime", "Red"]
```

---

## 3.5 Subject–Vector–Phase Encoding (4×4×4)
A structural decomposition into:

### Subjects (4)
```
ME, WE, YOU, THEY
```

### Vectors (4)
```
EAST, SOUTH, WEST, NORTH
```

### Phases (4)
```
SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER
```

Example:
```
YOU / WEST / AUTUMN
```

# 4. The 64‑Archetype Grid

SUBIT‑64 is generated by combining:

- 8 trigrams  
- 8 trigrams  
- 64 pairings  

Or equivalently:

- 4 subjects × 4 vectors × 4 phases  
- 8 colors × 8 colors  
- 3 bigrams  
- 6 bits  

All representations map to the same 64 archetypes.

Each archetype is defined by:

- id (0–63)  
- binary code  
- bigram triple  
- trigram pair  
- color pair  
- subject–vector–phase triple  
- canonical name  
- short description  

The full machine‑readable set is located in:

```
/schema/archetypes.json
```

# 5. Structural Dynamics

SUBIT is not only a static encoding — it is a **process operator**.

A SUBIT response always follows:

```
Tension:
Vector:
Interaction:
Meaning:
Action:
Structure:
```

This sequence models:

1. **Problem emergence**  
2. **Directional intention**  
3. **Relational dynamics**  
4. **Interpretation**  
5. **Transformation**  
6. **Stabilization**  

This makes SUBIT suitable for:

- reasoning  
- planning  
- creativity  
- analysis  
- decision‑making  
- agent workflows  

---

# 6. Architectural Principles

## 6.1 Minimality
SUBIT uses the smallest possible structure (6 bits) that still captures:

- tension  
- direction  
- relationality  
- interpretation  
- transformation  
- form  

## 6.2 Isomorphism
All representations (binary, trigram, color, etc.) are equivalent views of the same structure.

## 6.3 Universality
SUBIT applies to:

- text  
- processes  
- systems  
- decisions  
- emotions  
- strategies  
- narratives  

## 6.4 Determinism
Given the same input, SUBIT produces the same structural decomposition.

## 6.5 Extensibility
SUBIT can be extended with:

- transition maps  
- archetype families  
- embeddings  
- agent protocols

Example archetype:

```
ID: 14
Binary: 001110

Trigram: ["001", "110"]
Color: ["Green", "Burgundy"]
Subject: ME
Vector: NORTH
Phase: AUTUMN
Name: Boundary
Description: Definition of limits.
```
