# SUBIT Isomorphism Standard v1.0  
*Canonical Structural Equivalences for the SUBIT Operator*  

This document defines the **12 canonical isomorphic representations** of the SUBIT operator.  
Each representation is mathematically equivalent to the 6‑bit SUBIT state:

```
SUBIT = {0,1}⁶
```

These representations preserve structure, dimensionality, and ordering.  
They do **not** introduce semantics, symbolism, or interpretation.

---

# 1. Binary Representation (Canonical)
```
{0,1}⁶
```
Six independent binary axes.

---

# 2. Polarity Representation
```
{Yin, Yang}⁶
```
Direct polarity mapping of the six bits.

---

# 3. Energetic Polarity Representation
```
{Anima, Animus}⁶
```
Equivalent two‑pole system.

---

# 4. Structural Coordinate Triplet
```
{WHO, WHERE, WHEN}
```
Three orthogonal structural axes.

---

# 5. Scale Triplet
```
{MICRO, MACRO, META}
```
Three independent scale dimensions.

---

# 6. Bigram Representation (Binary)
```
{10, 11, 01, 00}³
```
Three bigrams, each from four possible states.

---

# 7. Bigram Representation (Abstract)
```
{4 bigrams}³
```
Equivalent abstract form.

---

# 8. Subject–Vector–Phase Triplet (Abstract)
```
{4 subjects, 4 vectors, 4 phases}
```
Three sets of four elements.

---

# 9. Subject–Vector–Phase Triplet (Concrete)
```
{ME/WE/YOU/THEY,
 EAST/SOUTH/WEST/NORTH,
 SPRING/SUMMER/AUTUMN/WINTER}
```
Concrete instantiation of the abstract triplet.

---

# 10. Trigram Representation (Abstract)
```
{8 trigrams}²
```
Two trigrams from the canonical set of eight.

---

# 11. Trigram Representation (Canonical Order)
```
{100,101,110,111,011,010,001,000}²
```
Canonical trigram ordering.

---

# 12. Color Representation (SUBIT Color Standard v1.0)
```
{Blue, Green, Lime, Yellow, Orange, Red, Burgundy, Purple}²
```
Two colors from the canonical 8‑color trigram palette.

---

# Notes

- All 12 representations are **strict isomorphisms**.  
- No representation adds or removes information.  
- No representation changes the dimensionality of the SUBIT operator.  
- These mappings are **structural**, not semantic.  
- Implementations MAY use any layer; all are equivalent.
